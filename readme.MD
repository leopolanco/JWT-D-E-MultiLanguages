I was a bit frustrated because I needed a php library who did everything I needed to do for a project but the issue was that I didn't know how to write in PHP,
So I created this repo to start creating a simple rest api with PHP, but creating a rest api in PHP may be too simple for me, and I ended up extending this project to multiple langues, just in case I ever need to use a library from them:

PHP
Go
Python
Rust
C
C++ 
C#
Java 8
Ruby
Assembly (For fun)


Each api will work around encoding a decoding a jwt

The first endpoint "/encode" will receive a json object and return a jwt

The second endpoint called "/decode" will receive a jwt and return its payload
